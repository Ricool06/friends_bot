_How you doin'?_

## Contributing
This repo is set up to use vscode devcontainers. Open the repo at the root, and vscode chould prompt you to repoen in a container.

To work on an individual project, open it inside the devcontainer by launching a terminal in the IDE and running `code ./projects/{func|notebooks}`

You will need to run `poetry install`, which will create a venv and install dependencies. You may need to relaunch any terminals so they adopt the virtual env.

The language model is stored in [GitHub Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) so you may need to run 'git lfs checkout' to get it on your file system.

### I am happy to accept pull requests, but any changes to the model will require additional approval. I don't want the bot generating hate speech or malicious content, so it will have to go throught further, manual testing.

Have fun!
